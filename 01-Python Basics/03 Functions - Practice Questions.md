# 01 - Python Programming Basics
## 03 - Functions

#### Answers to Practice Questions

1. Functions allow you to do repeatable tasks with one encapsulated code block

2. when the function is called is when it's executed

3. `def`

4. a function is the declaration (creation) of a function and a function call is a request to run the function in the program.  Without function calls, functions are never used.

5. how many global scopes - 1?  Local - as many as are created?  

6. Local variables are removed from memory after the function returns

7. return a value sends a value/variable that was calculated within the function back to the original code block that called the function.  Can a return value be part of an expression? Yes

8. if a function doesn't have return value then it returns `None`

9. good question  
XXX  
use `global`

10. No data type (`null`)  
XXX  
`NoneType`

11. imports the module called areallyourpetsnamederic

12. `spam.bacon()`

13. use error handling (try, catch)

14. in `try` goes the code that may throw an error.  In `except` goes exceptions  
Half right
